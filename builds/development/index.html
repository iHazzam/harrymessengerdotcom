        <h1>The Printed Cup Company - Order Tracking</h1>
        <p>I was hired by TPCC to develop additions to their order tracking site. On arrival at the company, I carried out a short ethnography and series of interviews with all of the users of the product, enabled by the factory and the sales office being in such close proximity. I then compiled a list of potential updates, and, according to a priority order decided by management, implemented some changes, including an entire new database-driven process flow of events, new aspects to the system such as faster lead times, custom error messages as well as completely rewriting the automated email dispatch system and the emails themselves. The system was developed in Laravel 4.1 and inspired my passion for back-end web dev to another level. </p>

        <h1>The Wedding Cup Company</h1>
        <p>Although not actually involved in writing the code for the site, from conception of concept to deployment of the finished site, I undertook to project manage the site. This involved setting timescales and deadlines, meetings both over the phone and in person, and working heavily alongside the developers and the marketing/graphic designers to ensure the site was built exactly how the client (TPCC, during the internship) wanted. I also took care of all of the hosting, email and deployment of the project. The project was completed on schedule and came in under budget.</p>

        <p>My first foray into PHP development, I was hired to create a locally hosted PHP app for a small company to manage their internal holiday requests calendar through. The goals were to provide scalable, adaptable functionality without the extra clutter provided by many off-the-shelf applications. The project was a success, and the company were pleased with the product. </p>

       <p>"I worked alongside Harry and The Wedding Cup company's team of professional graphic designers to design and create a medium-size wordpress webproject this summer for the company he was working at. Having someone with such a great understanding of the technical aspects of web design working for the client made my job much easier, and we were able to complete the project on time and under budget, partly thanks to Harry's excellent communication and project management skills" <br><br></p>

          <p>"During the time I have known Harry, he has proven that he is an intelligent and motivated individual who is more than capable of working alone or part of a team, regardless of their level. He is reliable, generous, knowledgeable, conscientious, good to work with and respected and liked by all his colleagues. I feel like he has good potential to develop further and wouldn't hesitate to employ him again as he would be a great asset to any business, whatever the industry. <br> <br></p>

        <h2>The Printed Cup Company</h2>

        <p>During three short months with us, Harry proved a huge value to our company by demonstrating not only wide-ranging technical skills, but also his intelligent and hard-working personality and his passion for both new and existing projects. By introducing standard operating procedures and source control policies and helping us recruit ,interview and hire a full-time developer, it is very unusual to find some one as articulate, and process driven as Harry.
            Harry has left a lasting, positive legacy at TPCC, and feel we have only seen the tip of the iceberg with what Harry is capable of. </p>
